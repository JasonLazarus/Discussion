# Collaborative Class Notes Links:

Each week, there will be a new shared Google document that we can use to take collaborative notes, share snippets of code, paste links, etc. Make sure you are logged in with your UC Davis Google account in order to access and edit these documents.

# How This Repository Works
Public discussion will be held in [the issues][] of this repository. To start a new thread, create a new issue. Tag your peers using their handle—`@ryanpeek`, for example—to get their attention.

[the issues]: https://github.com/gge-ucd/Discussion/issues

Lots of the good stuff will end up in [closed issues](https://github.com/gge-ucd/Discussion/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed), so don't forget to look there! Or, more generally, use the "Search" feature on this repository to find things.

This is a private repository that only our class has access to, so don't be shy! Please, if you have a question, someone else probably does too...ideally I'd like students to try answering each other and not just instructors!
