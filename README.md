# How This Repo Works
Public discussion will be held in [the issues][] of this repository. To start a new thread, create a new issue. Tag your peers using their handle—`@ryanpeek`, for example—to get their attention.

[the issues]: https://github.com/gge-ucd/Discussion/issues

Lots of the good stuff will end up in [closed issues](https://github.com/gge-ucd/Discussion/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed), so don't forget to look there! Or, more generally, use the "Search" feature on this repository to find things.

This is a private repo that only our class has access to, so don't be shy! Please, if you have a question, someone else probably does too...ideally I'd like students to try answering each other and not just instructors!
